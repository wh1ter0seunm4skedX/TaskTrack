# TaskTrack - To-Do List Web Application

This is **TaskTrack**, a web application for managing your daily tasks, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

## Current Features

- **Task Management**:
    - Add tasks with a title and description.
    - Display a list of tasks with options to mark as complete or delete.
    - Responsive design for all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Components Implemented**:
    - `TaskInput`: Allows users to input new tasks.
    - `TaskItem`: Displays each task with actions to complete or delete.
    - `TaskList`: Manages and displays the list of tasks.
- **TypeScript Integration**:
    - Using TypeScript for type safety, including defining the `Task` interface in `types.ts`.

## Upcoming Features

- **Edit Tasks**: Implement a feature to allow users to edit existing tasks.
- **Persistent Data**: Add a backend/database to persist tasks across sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Improve user experience by adding proper error messages when task operations fail.
